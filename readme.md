# Doppelganger

**Run against yourself** in a browser based platform runner.

Once you have run through the level your doppelganger emerges to race you, running just like you ran before. If you win the race against your doppelganger you will be thrown back, racing your ever faster self.

Use the arrow keys to control yourself. Note that you can also slow down or accelerate during a jump.

Doppelganger was made for the [GitHub Game Off 2017](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2017/rate/198253) with the theme **throwback**. You can play it on [itch.io](https://magers.itch.io/doppelganger).
